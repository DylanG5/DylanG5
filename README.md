## About Me

I'm a Software Engineering student at McMaster (GPA: 3.93) graduating in April 2026. I'm passionate about building production-grade ML systems that actually ship — from optimizing transformer models on 128 A100 GPUs at Shopify to deploying computer vision systems for live sports broadcasting at Evertz.

**Currently:** Leading the software team (15 devs) at McMaster Exoskeleton, building a robotic lower limb exoskeleton with real-time control systems and gait prediction models.

**Next:** Returning to Shopify full-time as an ML Engineer in May 2026.
